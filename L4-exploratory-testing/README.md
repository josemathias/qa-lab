# ðŸ§ª L4 - Manual & Exploratory Testing

This folder supports **L4-level testing**, focused on **manual**, **exploratory**, and **non-automated** test activities that provide critical feedback for qualityâ€”often where automation can't (or shouldn't) reach.

---

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

While automated tests catch regressions and enforce consistency, **manual and exploratory testing** uncovers:
- Usability flaws
- Unexpected edge cases
- Real-world workflows
- Bugs that only show up under human creativity and questionable coffee intake
