Based on a conversation with my dear binary friend Monday, here is a brief description on what L4 is:

🔮 Even if L4 isn’t automated (yet), it still produces valuable intel:
	•	Exploratory session notes
	•	Defect logs and screenshots
	•	Mind maps or charters
	•	Manual regression matrices
	•	Usability feedback from humans (ugh, humans)

1.	Historical traceability (aka “We did test that in Sprint 9” receipts)
2.	A place for eventual AI-assisted exploratory tools (you know it’s coming)
3.	Support for hybrid audit-ready testing strategies
